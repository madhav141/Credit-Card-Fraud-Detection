# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. In this project, that is exactly what I'm going to do. Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, I'll be going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project,I will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)<br>
Isolation Forest Algorithm

Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, I will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.

In addition, I'll explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set.
